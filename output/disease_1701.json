Aggregate estimate based on ameloblastoma incidence (~0.5-1 per million) and other odontogenic tumor types, estimated at ~0.8 per 100k person-years globally. Most are asymptomatic and detected incidentally on radiographs, leading to significant under-reporting in epidemiological databases. Limited population-based registry data.",
