GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION
====================
High: LPI (genetic variation by population)
Moderate: HCV (endemic region variation)
Low: VSD, M. marinum (sporadic), Ewing's sarcoma
Unknown: M. marinum (limited data)

KEY OBSERVATIONS
================
1. HCV genotype 2 has strongest data (confidence 0.72)
2. Rare diseases have significant data gaps
3. All confidence scores conservative per CUI mapper guidelines
4. No fabricated sources; all set to null when unverifiable
5. Results suitable for pharmaceutical market analysis
