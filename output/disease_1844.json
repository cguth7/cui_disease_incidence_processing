  "reasoning": "Chronic berylliosis is a rare occupational lung disease. General population incidence estimated at 0.05 per 100k person-years based on occupational health surveillance data. Incidence varies significantly with beryllium exposure level; among exposed workers with beryllium sensitization, annual incidence of progression to chronic berylliosis is approximately 1-3%. Confidence moderate due to disease specificity to occupational exposure rather than general population.",
