Global incidence estimated at ~78 per 100k based on screening prevalence patterns, varying from 2-3 per 100k in unscreened populations to 200+ per 100k in well-screened populations. Uses incidence metric (new diagnoses/detections per person-years). Confidence limited due to extreme geographic heterogeneity in screening coverage and HPV vaccination rates globally.",
