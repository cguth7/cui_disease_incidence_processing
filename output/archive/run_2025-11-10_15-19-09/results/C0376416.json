  "reasoning": "Myocardial hibernation is a reversible contractility reduction secondary to chronic coronary artery disease. Estimated from CAD incidence (~3-4 per 100k) with 10-40% of CAD patients experiencing hibernation, yielding ~2.5 per 100k. Low confidence due to lack of dedicated registry data and inconsistent clinical identification.",
