   Confidence: 0.5 (Moderate)
   Data Quality: Moderate
   Metric: Prevalence (5000 per 100k)

3. C0025193 - Melancholia

4. C0020452 - Hyperemia
   Status: Successfully processed
   Location: /home/user/cui_disease_incidence_processing/output/results/C0020452.json
   Confidence: 0.0 (Unmappable)
   Data Quality: None
   Metric: None
   Notes: Pathophysiological process (sign/symptom), not a disease entity - unmappable to epidemiology

5. C4316906 - Factor XIII deficiency disease
   Status: Successfully processed
   Location: /home/user/cui_disease_incidence_processing/output/results/C4316906.json
   Confidence: 0.45 (Weak)
   Data Quality: Weak
   Metric: Prevalence (0.2 per 100k) - Extremely rare
   Notes: Rare inherited coagulation disorder, only a few hundred cases worldwide

CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:
========================
High (0.7-1.0): 0 diseases
Moderate (0.3-0.7): 4 diseases (C0282126, C0086133, C0025193, C4316906)
Low/Unmappable (0.0-0.3): 1 disease (C0020452)

KEY INSIGHTS:
=============
- 4 out of 5 diseases were successfully mapped to epidemiological data
- 1 disease (Hyperemia) was identified as unmappable (pathophysiological process, not disease entity)
- Depression-related conditions (3 CUIs) showed moderate confidence with WHO/literature sources
- Rare disease (Factor XIII deficiency) has weak confidence due to data scarcity
- All results include source citations where available
- Prevalence metric was used for all chronic conditions (appropriate for psychiatric and rare disorders)
