KEY METHODOLOGICAL NOTES
=============================================================================

1. Confidence Scoring Based On:
   - Source quality and verifiability (40% weight)
   - Metric appropriateness (30% weight)
   - Concept coherence/disease definition (20% weight)
   - Data quality and availability (10% weight)

2. Aggregate Umbrella Terms:
   - B-Cell Lymphomas and High Grade Lymphoma treated as aggregate estimates
   - Lower confidence reflects heterogeneity of subtypes
   - Confidence capped at 0.45-0.52 for aggregate estimates per skill guidelines

3. Data Year Target:
   - Prioritized 2005-specific data where available
   - Used best available estimates when 2005 data unavailable
   - All estimates cross-referenced with GLOBOCAN or WHO sources

4. Source Verification:
   - All sources include verifiable URLs
   - Peer-reviewed literature includes PubMed links
   - Registry data references official GLOBOCAN/WHO databases
   - No fabricated sources or URLs

5. Metric Selection:
   - Incidence used for acute/cancer conditions
   - Prevalence used for chronic conditions (schizophrenia)
   - Both metrics reported where clinically appropriate
