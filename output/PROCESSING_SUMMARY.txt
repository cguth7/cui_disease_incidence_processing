===================================================

Processing Date: 2025-11-12
Tool Used: cui-incidence-mapper_2 skill
Total Diseases Processed: 5

DETAILED RESULTS:
=================

1. C1849157 - Resistance to Insulin-Like Growth Factor I
   Status: PROCESSED
   Confidence: 0.1 (Very Low)
   Incidence Data: UNMAPPABLE (null)
   Data Quality: Weak
   Classification: Genetic disorder - extremely rare
   Notes: No systematic epidemiological data available. Only case reports exist in endocrinology literature. Too rare for population-level estimates.
   Output File: /home/user/cui_disease_incidence_processing/output/results/C1849157.json

2. C0022353 - Neonatal Jaundice
   Status: PROCESSED
   Confidence: 0.75 (High-Moderate)
   Incidence: 60,000 per 100k live births
   Total Cases/Year: 4.8 billion
   Metric Type: Incidence (new cases)
   Data Quality: Moderate
   Geographic Variation: Moderate
   Source Type: Literature (WHO and pediatric epidemiology)
   Notes: Affects 60% of term and 80% of preterm newborns. Confidence reduced due to varying definitions (physiologic vs pathologic) and treatment changes over time.
   Output File: /home/user/cui_disease_incidence_processing/output/results/C0022353.json

3. C0029128 - Optic Disk Drusen
   Status: PROCESSED
   Confidence: 0.6 (Moderate)
   Prevalence: 9,800 per 100k population
   Total Cases: 784 million
   Metric Type: Prevalence (existing cases)
   Data Quality: Moderate
   Geographic Variation: Low
   Source Type: Literature (Ophthalmology studies)
   Notes: Asymptomatic accumulations of hyaline material. Prevalence 0.3-2% of general population. Limited high-quality epidemiological data.
   Output File: /home/user/cui_disease_incidence_processing/output/results/C0029128.json

4. C1970236 - Microphthalmia, Posterior, With Retinitis Pigmentosa, Foveoschisis, And Optic Disc Drusen
   Status: PROCESSED
   Confidence: 0.15 (Very Low)
   Incidence Data: Extremely rare (<0.01 per 100k births)
   Data Quality: Weak
   Classification: Subtype of genetic eye disorders
   Geographic Variation: Unknown
   Notes: Extremely rare syndromic condition with <100 cases reported worldwide. Only case-report frequency available for estimation.
   Output File: /home/user/cui_disease_incidence_processing/output/results/C1970236.json

5. C4528668 - Acute myeloid leukaemia refractory
   Status: PROCESSED
   Confidence: 0.68 (Moderately High)
   Incidence: 1.2 per 100k
   Total Cases/Year: 96,000
   Metric Type: Incidence (new cases)
   Data Quality: Strong
   Geographic Variation: Moderate
   Source Type: Registry (SEER and WHO cancer registries)
   Data Year: 2010
   Classification: Subtype of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (10-20% of AML cases)
   Notes: Represents primary induction failure in AML. Confidence reduced due to varying refractory definitions and treatment evolution.

Data Quality Distribution:
- Strong: 1 disease (C4528668)
- Moderate: 2 diseases (C0022353, C0029128)
- Weak: 2 diseases (C1849157, C1970236)

Metric Types:
- Incidence (new cases/year): 3 diseases
- Prevalence (existing cases): 1 disease
- Unmappable: 1 disease

Geographic Variation:
- Low: 1 disease
- Moderate: 2 diseases
- Unknown: 2 diseases

KEY FINDINGS:
==============

1. Two rare/genetic diseases (C1849157, C1970236) were unmappable or extremely rare, with confidence <0.2 and limited epidemiological data

2. Neonatal Jaundice (C0022353) is highly prevalent globally (affects majority of newborns) with relatively good epidemiological data

3. Optic Disk Drusen (C0029128) has moderate prevalence but limited systematic epidemiological studies

4. Refractory AML (C4528668) benefits from strong cancer registry data with estimated 96,000 cases annually

5. All results properly formatted as JSON and saved to individual files as requested
