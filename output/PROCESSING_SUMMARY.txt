5. C1701938 - Associated Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
   Status: SUCCESS
   Incidence: 2.5 per 100k
   Prevalence: 26.0 per 100k
   Confidence: 0.55 (MODERATE)
   Data Quality: moderate
   Location: /home/user/cui_disease_incidence_processing/output/results/C1701938.json
   Note: Secondary PAH with heterogeneous etiologies

CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION
=======================
- Very Low (0.0-0.3):     2 diseases (40%)
- Low (0.3-0.5):          2 diseases (40%)
- Moderate (0.5-0.7):     1 disease  (20%)
- High (0.7-1.0):         0 diseases (0%)

DATA QUALITY DISTRIBUTION
==========================
- None:     1 disease (20%)
- Weak:     3 diseases (60%)
- Moderate: 1 disease (20%)
- Strong:   0 diseases (0%)

KEY FINDINGS
============
- All 5 diseases are rare conditions with limited epidemiological data
- None have strong Tier 1 sources (registries, peer-reviewed literature with exact URLs)
- 4 out of 5 diseases have confidence < 0.5 due to data limitations
- 2 diseases marked as "extremely rare" (C4755308, C4305253)
- Associated PAH (C1701938) has the highest confidence (0.55) due to more available data

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT
================================
1. Seek peer-reviewed literature for rare disease epidemiology
2. Identify registry data for genetic disorders
3. For "extremely rare" conditions, conduct systematic literature reviews
4. Consider multi-center studies for uncommon conditions
5. Improve source documentation when additional data becomes available
