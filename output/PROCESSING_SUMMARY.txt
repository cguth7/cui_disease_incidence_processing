   - Type: Specific symptom/condition (subtype of Jaundice)
   - Incidence: 85 per 100k per year
   - Confidence: 0.60 (moderate)
   - Metric: Incidence (new cases)
   - Reasoning: Primarily driven by choledocholithiasis (60-70) and malignancy-related obstruction (15-20)
   - Data Quality: Moderate
   - Geographic Variation: Moderate
   - Data Year: 2004
   - Status: Processed successfully

OUTPUT FILES:
=============

All individual results written to:
/home/user/cui_disease_incidence_processing/output/results/

Individual result files created:
- C3826128.json (Infection in children)
- C1959859.json (Acute lyme disease)
- C0042075.json (Urologic Diseases)
- C0262655.json (Recurrent urinary tract infection)
- C0022354.json (Jaundice, Obstructive)

Each JSON file contains:
- CUI code and disease name
- Incidence/prevalence metrics (per 100k per year)
- Global total cases per year estimates
- Confidence score with detailed reasoning
- Data quality and geographic variation assessment
- Source attribution and URLs when available
- Year-specific data notes

QUALITY NOTES:
==============

1. Umbrella Terms (2): Lower confidence scores (0.22-0.25) reflect the challenge of estimating aggregate incidence for broad disease categories. These use BOTEC (Back of the Envelope Calculation) methodology summing major subcategories.

2. Specific Diseases (3): Higher confidence scores reflect more precise epidemiological data, particularly for Acute Lyme disease (0.78) which has excellent CDC surveillance data.

3. Geographic Variation: Noted where applicable - especially for Lyme disease (endemic regional variation) and Obstructive Jaundice (population-specific gallstone prevalence).

4. Data Sourcing: 
   - Registry data: CDC Lyme Disease Surveillance
   - Literature sources: Peer-reviewed epidemiological studies with PubMed citations
   - Estimated calculations: BOTEC sums where direct data unavailable

5. Metric Type: All diseases reported as incidence (new cases per 100k person-years) except where noted as inappropriate for the condition.
