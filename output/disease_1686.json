Newborn screening data indicates major detectable IEMs collectively occur at ~1-2% of births (PKU ~1:10,000, galactosemia ~1:40,000, MSUD ~1:185,000, and dozens of other conditions). Aggregated across major subcategories: phenylketonuria, galactosemia, maple syrup urine disease, mitochondrial disorders, lysosomal storage disorders, organic acidemias, fatty acid oxidation disorders, urea cycle disorders, and others. Estimated at ~30 per 100k person-years. Actual burden higher when including undetected and late-onset presentations. No single comprehensive source available.",
