Prevalence estimated at ~9.6% (9,600 per 100k) based on overall gallstone disease prevalence of 10-15% in developed populations. Reported as prevalence (proportion with stones) rather than incidence, as gallstone disease is chronic and typically asymptomatic. No specific epidemiological registry data for cholesterol stones alone; estimate derived from combined gallstone prevalence and known proportion of cholesterol type.",
