Annual Global Cases: 96,000
Confidence: 0.45
Data Quality: Weak

Note: May be independent or secondary to trigeminal neuralgia

C0423712 - NEURALGIA, ILIOHYPOGASTRIC NERVE
Status: MAPPED (Very Low Confidence)
Estimated Incidence: 0.5 per 100,000 person-years
Annual Global Cases: 40,000
Confidence: 0.30
Data Quality: Weak
Parent Disease: Neuralgia
Clinical Context: Rare nerve compression syndrome (often post-hernia repair)
Note: Largely documented through case reports only

ESTIMATED GLOBAL DISEASE BURDEN
================================================================================

Disease                     | Inc/100k | Annual Cases | % of Total
----------------------------|----------|--------------|----------
Neuralgia, Atypical        | 2.5      | 200,000      | 50.0%
Neuralgia, Supraorbital    | 1.2      | 96,000       | 24.0%
Neuralgia, Perineal        | 0.8      | 64,000       | 16.0%
Neuralgia, Iliohypogastric | 0.5      | 40,000       | 10.0%
----------------------------|----------|--------------|----------
TOTAL (excl. C0205622)      | 5.0      | 400,000      | 100%

Note: C0205622 excluded as not a standalone disease. World population: 8 billion.

================================================================================
DATA QUALITY & CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

Confidence Scoring Factors:
1. Source Quality & Verifiability (40%) - ALL: 0/10 (No verifiable sources)
2. Metric Appropriateness (30%) - ALL: ~6/10 (Incidence appropriate for acute/pain conditions)
3. Concept Coherence (20%) - Mixed:
   - C0205622: 0/10 (Descriptor, not disease)
   - C0234247: 3/10 (Vague diagnosis)
   - C0423711-C0423712: 5/10 (Specific but rare)
4. Data Availability (10%) - POOR: Case reports only, no registry data

Result: All confidence scores ≤0.45 due to:
- Absence of peer-reviewed epidemiological studies
- Lack of population-based registry data
- Limited case report frequency
- Diagnostic ambiguity

RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

For Pharmaceutical Market Analysis:
1. Do NOT use C0205622 independently - specify primary tumor type instead
2. C0234247 shows largest market potential (200k cases/year) but very uncertain
3. Specific neuralgias (C0423711-C0423712) are niche markets; combined <150k cases/year
4. Total addressable market: ~400k cases/year with HIGH UNCERTAINTY

For Clinical Use:
1. Consider broader "Neuralgia" category instead of specific subtypes
2. Conduct further diagnostic clarification studies
3. Use specialized pain/neurology registries for patient identification

For Regulatory/Research:
1. Establish standardized diagnostic criteria for atypical neuralgia
2. Create international registries for rare nerve compression syndromes
3. Fund epidemiological studies on specific neuralgia subtypes
