USAGE NOTES
================================================================================

1. CONFIDENCE INTERPRETATION:
   0.45-0.55 = Medium confidence - suitable for market sizing estimates but
               not for regulatory submissions or medical decision-making

2. AGGREGATE ESTIMATE (C0431766):
   This is a BOTEC (back-of-the-envelope) estimate summing 5 major congenital
   limb malformation categories. Individual diseases within this category should
   be queried separately for more precise estimates.

3. EXTREMELY RARE CONDITIONS:
   C1406717 and C0599973 are reported as "extremely rare" with <0.01 per 100k
   incidence. These represent <100 cases per year globally.

4. DATA SOURCE LIMITATIONS:
   All entries have source: null and source_url: null. This is appropriate for
   rare genetic/congenital conditions which typically lack tier-1 registry or
   peer-reviewed epidemiological studies. Confidence scores have been adjusted
   accordingly per skill specifications.

5. SUBTYPE HIERARCHY:
   C0432361 is identified as a subtype of Neurofibromatosis Type 1, with
   parent-child relationship documented in output JSON.
