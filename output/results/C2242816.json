Approximately 5% of population affected (5,000 per 100k) with higher prevalence in children. Based on pediatric epidemiological studies showing 20-90% of children experience OME at some point, with chronic form affecting 5-10% persistently. Confidence moderate due to age-dependent variation and limited systematic incidence data.",
