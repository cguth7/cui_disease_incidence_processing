NEXT STEPS
================================================================================
1. All JSON files ready for pharmaceutical patent analysis
2. High-confidence diseases can be used directly in market sizing
3. Low-confidence umbrella terms should be broken into specific subtypes
4. Consider geographic stratification for high-variation diseases
5. Review supplementary sources for disease-specific validation
