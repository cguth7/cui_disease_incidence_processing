Global stroke incidence ~24 per 100k (WHO 2005); assuming 20% develop depression within first year yields ~4.8 per 100k incidence of new PSD cases annually. Prevalence of existing depression in stroke population estimated at ~12% (12,000 per 100k among stroke survivors). Data quality moderate due to heterogeneity in diagnostic criteria and variation in screening practices across studies.",
