It can occur secondarily in various conditions including chronic pyelonephritis, chronic obstructive uropathy, chronic kidney disease, and other renal pathologies. Too heterogeneous and vague to estimate incidence or prevalence meaningfully without specification of underlying cause. Requires clinical context for meaningful epidemiological assessment.",
