Global incidence estimated <0.01 per 100k births. Fewer than 1000 cases reported worldwide since first description in 1933. No systematic epidemiological data; prevalence estimated from case report frequency and registry data (Japan registry: ~60 cases in population of 127 million = ~0.05 per 100k).",
