  "reasoning": "Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD/Seitelberger disease) is an extremely rare autosomal recessive neurogenetic disorder caused by PLA2G6 mutations. Fewer than 150 cases documented worldwide. Onset typically 6-18 months with rapid neurological regression. No systematic epidemiological data exists; disease tracked primarily through case reports and rare disease registries. Confidence reflects extreme rarity and absence of population-based incidence studies.",
