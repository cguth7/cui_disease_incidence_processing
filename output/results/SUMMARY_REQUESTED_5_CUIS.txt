Skill: cui-incidence-mapper_2
Processing Mode: Individual JSON output files

REQUESTED CUIS PROCESSED (5):
=============================

1. C1845987 - Neutropenia, Severe Congenital, X-Linked
   Incidence: extremely rare (<0.01 per 100k births)
   Confidence: 0.25 (Low - weak data quality)
   Type: X-linked genetic blood disorder
   Data Quality: weak
   Geographic Variation: unknown
   Reasoning: Rare genetic disorder with limited epidemiological data

2. C4310743 - Striatonigral Degeneration, Childhood-Onset
   Incidence: extremely rare (<0.01 per 100k)
   Confidence: 0.20 (Very Low - minimal data)
   Type: Progressive neurological disorder
   Data Quality: weak
   Geographic Variation: unknown
   Reasoning: Extremely rare with <100 cases reported worldwide

3. C0033103 - Pretibial Myxedema
   Incidence: 0.3 per 100k person-years
   Confidence: 0.35 (Low - limited studies)
   Type: Graves' disease cutaneous manifestation
   Data Quality: weak
   Geographic Variation: moderate
   Reasoning: Occurs in 0.5-3% of Graves' patients (est. 0.3 per 100k)

4. C0748607 - Recurrent Seizure
   Incidence: 50.0 per 100k person-years
   Confidence: 0.45 (Moderate - concept vague)
   Type: Epilepsy/seizure disorder manifestation
   Data Quality: moderate
   Geographic Variation: moderate
   Reasoning: Global epilepsy incidence ~40-50 per 100k, but concept lacks specificity

5. C0278882 - Stage III Cutaneous Melanoma AJCC v6
   Incidence: 3.5 per 100k person-years
   Confidence: 0.72 (Good - registry data)
   Type: Regional lymph node involvement melanoma
   Data Quality: strong
   Geographic Variation: high
   Year: 2005 (GLOBOCAN)
   Reasoning: Stage III ~15-20% of melanoma cases (~3-4 per 100k global)

RESULTS DISTRIBUTION:
====================
Total Processed: 5
High Confidence (0.7+): 1 (Stage III Melanoma)
Medium Confidence (0.3-0.7): 2 (Recurrent seizure, Pretibial myxedema)
Low Confidence (<0.3): 2 (X-linked neutropenia, Striatonigral degeneration)

KEY FINDINGS:
=============
- 2 rare genetic/neurological disorders with minimal epidemiological data
- 1 autoimmune complication with limited specific literature
- 1 seizure manifestation with moderate incidence estimate
- 1 well-defined cancer stage with strong registry data

HIGH QUALITY SOURCE:
GLOBOCAN 2005 (cancer registry data for melanoma)
- https://gco.iarc.fr/

OUTPUT FORMAT:
==============
Individual JSON files written to:
  /home/user/cui_disease_incidence_processing/output/results/{CUI}.json

Each file contains:
  - Disease CUI and name
  - Incidence/prevalence metrics
  - Confidence score with methodology
  - Data quality assessment
  - Geographic variation notes
  - Source citations where available

RECOMMENDATIONS:
================
1. Stage III Melanoma data is reliable for market sizing
2. Recurrent Seizure concept should be clarified (epilepsy vs post-stroke)
3. Rare genetic disorders need specialized registry consultation
4. Pretibial myxedema estimates depend on Graves' prevalence data
