  "reasoning": "Periodontal infection is a chronic condition best measured by prevalence, but incidence data also available. Prevalence of periodontitis: 62% (62,000 per 100k) with severe periodontitis at 23.6% based on 2011-2020 meta-analysis. Cumulative incidence has grown to 936 per 100,000. Significant geographic variation: high-income countries 43.7%, low-income 28.7%. Reporting both metrics as incidence captures new disease occurrence while prevalence reflects burden of chronic infection. 12th most prevalent pathology globally.",
