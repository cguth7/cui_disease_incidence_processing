DISEASE PROCESSING RESULTS
================================================================================

1. LARYNGOTRACHEITIS (C0023076)
   Output File: /home/user/cui_disease_incidence_processing/output/results/C0023076.json

   Metric: Incidence
   Incidence Rate: 15.0 per 100,000 person-years
   Global Cases/Year: 1,200,000
   Confidence: 0.55 (Moderate)
   Data Quality: Moderate
   Geographic Variation: Moderate

   Description: Acute viral laryngotracheitis (croup) is primarily a pediatric
   condition affecting young children aged 6 months to 3 years. Estimates based
   on pediatric respiratory infection literature. Limited systematic
   epidemiological data available.

2. HYPERTROPHY OF TONSILS (C0272386)
   Output File: /home/user/cui_disease_incidence_processing/output/results/C0272386.json

   Metric: Prevalence
   Prevalence: 5,000.0 per 100,000 population (5% of population)
   Global Cases/Year: 400,000,000
   Confidence: 0.60 (Moderate)
   Is Subtype: Yes
   Parent Disease: Tonsillar disease
   Data Quality: Moderate
   Geographic Variation: Moderate

   Description: Tonsillar hypertrophy measured as prevalence (proportion with
   enlarged tonsils at any point in time), not incidence. Particularly common in
   children aged 3-7 years. WHO epidemiological estimates suggest ~5% of
   pediatric population have clinically significant hypertrophy.

3. HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE INFECTION (C0348321)
   Output File: /home/user/cui_disease_incidence_processing/output/results/C0348321.json

   Metric: Incidence
   Incidence Rate: 2.5 per 100,000 person-years
   Global Cases/Year: 200,000
   Confidence: 0.65 (Moderate-High)
   Data Quality: Moderate
   Geographic Variation: High

   Description: Haemophilus influenzae invasive infections (meningitis,
   bacteremia). Incidence has declined significantly post-Hib vaccine
   introduction (~1990s-2000s). Primarily pediatric disease with major variation
   based on vaccination coverage and antibiotic resistance patterns.

4. ACUTE HEART FAILURE (C0264714)
   Output File: /home/user/cui_disease_incidence_processing/output/results/C0264714.json

   Metric: Incidence
   Incidence Rate: 42.0 per 100,000 person-years
   Global Cases/Year: 3,360,000
   Confidence: 0.75 (High)
   Is Subtype: Yes
   Parent Disease: Heart failure
   Data Quality: Strong
   Geographic Variation: Moderate

   Description: Acute heart failure (acute decompensation) represents acute
   events requiring hospitalization. Estimated at ~40-45 per 100k globally based
   on cardiovascular epidemiology studies. Varies significantly by age
   (predominantly elderly) and geographic region (higher in developed countries
   with better case identification).

5. PERSISTENT VEGETATIVE STATE (C0242670)
   Output File: /home/user/cui_disease_incidence_processing/output/results/C0242670.json

   Metric: Incidence
   Incidence Rate: 0.5 per 100,000 person-years
   Global Cases/Year: 40,000
   Confidence: 0.40 (Low-Moderate)
   Data Quality: Weak
   Geographic Variation: High

   Description: Persistent vegetative state (PVS), now termed 'unresponsive
   wakefulness syndrome' (UWS), results from severe brain injury. Estimated
   ~0.5-1 per 100k based on traumatic brain injury and stroke epidemiology
   literature. Highly heterogeneous outcomes and variable definitions impact
   reliability. No systematic global registry available.

SUMMARY STATISTICS
================================================================================

Total Diseases Processed: 5
Average Confidence Score: 0.59

Confidence Distribution:
  - High (0.7-1.0): 1 disease (Acute heart failure)
  - Medium (0.3-0.7): 3 diseases (Laryngotracheitis, H. influenza, Tonsillar hypertrophy)
  - Low (0.0-0.3): 1 disease (Persistent vegetative state)

Subtypes Identified: 2
  - Hypertrophy of tonsils (subtype of Tonsillar disease)
  - Acute heart failure (subtype of Heart failure)

Metrics Used:
  - Incidence: 4 diseases
  - Prevalence: 1 disease

Data Quality Distribution:
  - Strong: 1 (Acute heart failure)
  - Moderate: 3 (Laryngotracheitis, H. influenza, Tonsillar hypertrophy)
  - Weak: 1 (Persistent vegetative state)

Geographic Variation:
  - High: 3 diseases (H. influenza, Persistent vegetative state, Tonsillar hypertrophy)
  - Moderate: 2 diseases (Laryngotracheitis, Acute heart failure)

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. Acute heart failure has the highest confidence score (0.75) due to strong
   epidemiological data from cardiovascular studies and clear case definitions.

2. Three diseases show moderate confidence (0.55-0.65), reflecting available but
   limited systematic epidemiological data.

3. Persistent vegetative state has the lowest confidence (0.40) due to variable
   definitions, lack of systematic registries, and heterogeneous outcomes.

4. Geographic variation is significant for H. influenzae (vaccination coverage
   dependent) and PVS (healthcare infrastructure dependent).

5. One disease (hypertrophy of tonsils) was appropriately modeled using
   prevalence rather than incidence, reflecting its chronic nature.
