  "reasoning": "Locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma (LASCC) is a subset of SCC diagnoses. Global SCC incidence varies by site: head/neck ~17 per 100k, lung ~20 per 100k, other sites variable. Locally advanced stage represents approximately 30-40% of SCC cases at diagnosis. Estimated LASCC incidence ~8-10 per 100k globally. Stage distribution and geographic variation significantly affect estimates.",
