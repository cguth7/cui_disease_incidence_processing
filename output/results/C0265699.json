  "reasoning": "Morgagni hernia is a specific congenital diaphragmatic defect with estimated incidence of 1 in 2000-5000 live births, corresponding to ~3.5 per 100k births. Comprises 2-5% of all congenital diaphragmatic hernias. 90% occur on right side; 34-50% associated with other congenital anomalies (cardiac defects 25-60%, trisomy 21 15-71%). Only ~30% are symptomatic; most detected later in childhood/adulthood. Confidence moderate due to uncertainty in true incidence and small denominator.",
