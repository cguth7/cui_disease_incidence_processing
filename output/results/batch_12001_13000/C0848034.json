Global incidence approximately 28-35 per 100k women, with prevalence around 150 per 100k based on screening data. HPV-16/18 are responsible for ~70% of cases. Incidence varies significantly based on HPV vaccination coverage and screening programs. CIN progression risk: CIN1 ~60% regression, CIN3 ~30% progression to invasive cancer.",
