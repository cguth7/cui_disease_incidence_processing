  "reasoning": "ASD is the most common congenital heart defect, ~1.4-2.5 per 1000 live births (140-250 per 100k). ASD9 is a specific genetic form caused by TBX5 mutations. As a molecularly-defined subtype, ASD9 represents subset of overall ASD incidence. Estimated 10-30% of familial ASDs may have genetic basis. Conservative estimate for ASD9 specific form: ~150 per 100k based on ASD prevalence with adjustments for genetic subtype frequency.",
