SUMMARY STATISTICS:
===================
- Total Confidence Score (Average): 0.53
- High Confidence (0.7+): 0 diseases
- Moderate Confidence (0.3-0.7): 4 diseases
- Low/Weak Confidence (<0.3): 1 disease
- Diseases with Prevalence Data: 3
- Diseases with Incidence Data: 4
- Subtypes Identified: 5 (all are subtypes)

CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:
- Strong (0.7-1.0): 0 diseases (0%)
- Moderate (0.3-0.7): 4 diseases (80%)
- Weak (0.0-0.3): 1 disease (20%)

DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
- Strong: 0 diseases
- Moderate: 3 diseases
- Weak: 2 diseases

KEY FINDINGS:
=============
1. All 5 diseases are identified as subtypes of broader disease categories
2. Rare diseases (C1332982, C4706413) have low confidence scores due to limited data
3. Most results include verifiable peer-reviewed sources with PubMed URLs
4. Geographic variation noted for stimulant dependence (high) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (moderate)
5. Two diseases (C0338582, C0346303, C2711618) provide both incidence and prevalence metrics
6. Conservative confidence scoring applied per skill guidelines

VALIDATION:
===========
All JSON files created with complete field population:
- CUI and disease names properly mapped
- Incidence/prevalence values appropriate for disease type
- Confidence scores reflect source quality and data availability
- All results include proper reasoning and methodology
- Parent-child disease relationships identified correctly
