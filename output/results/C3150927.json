  "reasoning": "Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a common urological condition in children, with overall prevalence ~1-2% of population. VUR is graded 1-5 by severity; grade 3 is moderate reflux (ureter and renal pelvis dilated without calix blunting). Approximately 25-30% of VUR cases are grade 3 or higher severity. Grade 3 incidence estimated at ~0.85-1 per 100k children annually (~8-9 per 100k in pediatric population). Global VUR incidence ~8.5 per 100k in pediatric populations based on multiple cohort studies.",
