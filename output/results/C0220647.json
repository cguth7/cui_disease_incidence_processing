Population-based incidence rate of 4.1 per 100,000 (age-adjusted to World Segi 1960 population). CUP represents a heterogeneous group of metastatic cancers where primary tumor remains unidentified after standardized diagnostic workup. Incidence has been declining since early 1980s due to improved diagnostic techniques.",
