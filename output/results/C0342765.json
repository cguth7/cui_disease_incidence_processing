Prevalence is unknown according to Orphanet and NIH rare disease databases. Only scattered case reports exist in medical literature. Characterized by abnormal urinary excretion of D-glyceric acid with highly variable phenotype ranging from severe encephalopathy with seizures to mild intellectual delay or normal development. Insufficient epidemiological data for incidence estimation.",
