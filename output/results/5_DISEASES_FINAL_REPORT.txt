PROCESSING SUMMARY
================================================================================

1. C0022573 - Keratoconjunctivitis
   Status: PROCESSED
   File: /home/user/cui_disease_incidence_processing/output/results/C0022573.json
   
   Incidence: 45.0 per 100k
   Confidence: 0.55 (Moderate)
   Data Quality: Moderate
   Metric: Incidence
   Is Subtype: No
   
   Key Findings:
   - Heterogeneous disease with multiple etiologies (viral, bacterial, autoimmune)
   - Global incidence estimated at ~45 per 100k based on endemic and epidemic forms
   - High geographic variation
   - No specific peer-reviewed epidemiological source identified
   - Low confidence due to lack of unified data

2. C1867923 - Posterior column ataxia
   Status: PROCESSED
   File: /home/user/cui_disease_incidence_processing/output/results/C1867923.json
   
   Incidence: 1.5 per 100k
   Confidence: 0.35 (Low)
   Data Quality: Weak
   Metric: Incidence
   Is Subtype: No
   Parent Disease: Spastic ataxia
   
   Key Findings:
   - Multiple etiologies (B12 deficiency, demyelinating disease, genetic conditions)
   - Estimated incidence ~1.5 per 100k from aggregate cause incidence
   - High geographic variation based on B12 deficiency prevalence
   - Limited specific epidemiological studies
   - Aggregate estimate from multiple causes

3. C1836916 - POSTERIOR COLUMN ATAXIA WITH RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA
   Status: PROCESSED
   File: /home/user/cui_disease_incidence_processing/output/results/C1836916.json
   
   Incidence: Extremely rare
   Confidence: 0.30 (Low)
   Data Quality: Weak
   Metric: Incidence
   Is Subtype: Yes
   Parent Disease: Spastic ataxia with ophthalmological involvement
   
   Key Findings:
   - Rare syndrome combining posterior column ataxia + retinitis pigmentosa
   - Likely represents specific inherited conditions (mitochondrial disorders, etc.)
   - Estimated <0.1 per 100k births
   - Very low confidence due to rarity
   - Limited epidemiological data available

4. C4684879 - Metastatic Bile Duct Carcinoma
   Status: PROCESSED
   File: /home/user/cui_disease_incidence_processing/output/results/C4684879.json
   
   Incidence: 1.2 per 100k
   Confidence: 0.48 (Moderate-Low)
   Data Quality: Moderate
   Metric: Incidence
   Is Subtype: Yes
   Parent Disease: Cholangiocarcinoma
   Data Year: 2005
   
   Key Findings:
   - Based on GLOBOCAN 2005 cholangiocarcinoma incidence (~2.5 per 100k)
   - Metastatic disease at diagnosis: ~40-50% of cases
   - Estimated metastatic incidence: 1.2 per 100k
   - High geographic variation (endemic HBV/HCV regions vary significantly)
   - Confidence limited by proportion estimation methodology

5. C1881236 - Interstitial Disease
   Status: PROCESSED
   File: /home/user/cui_disease_incidence_processing/output/results/C1881236.json
   
   Incidence: NULL (Unmappable)
   Confidence: 0.0 (No Data)
   Data Quality: None
   Metric: None
   Is Subtype: No
   
   Key Findings:
   - Umbrella term too broad for meaningful estimation
   - Could refer to multiple conditions:
     * Interstitial lung disease (ILD)
     * Interstitial nephritis
     * Interstitial fibrosis
     * Interstitial conditions across multiple organ systems
   - Requires specification of organ system or disease type
   - No aggregate estimate provided (clinically not meaningful)

CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION
================================================================================

High Confidence (0.7-1.0):     0 diseases
Moderate Confidence (0.5-0.7): 1 disease (Keratoconjunctivitis - 0.55)
Low Confidence (0.3-0.5):      2 diseases (Posterior column ataxia - 0.35, Metastatic Bile Duct Carcinoma - 0.48)
Very Low (0.1-0.3):            1 disease (Posterior column ataxia + retinitis pigmentosa - 0.30)
Unmappable (0.0):              1 disease (Interstitial Disease - 0.0)

================================================================================
DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

Strong:     0 diseases
Moderate:   2 diseases (Keratoconjunctivitis, Metastatic Bile Duct Carcinoma)
Weak:       2 diseases (Posterior column ataxia, Posterior column ataxia + RP)
None:       1 disease (Interstitial Disease)

================================================================================
GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION
================================================================================

High:       3 diseases (Keratoconjunctivitis, Posterior column ataxia, Metastatic Bile Duct Carcinoma)
Unknown:    2 diseases (Posterior column ataxia + RP, Interstitial Disease)

================================================================================
KEY OBSERVATIONS
================================================================================

1. Heterogeneous Disease Types: Mix of common (keratoconjunctivitis), rare 
   (neurological syndromes), specific cancers (metastatic bile duct), and 
   umbrella terms (interstitial disease).

2. Data Availability: Only one disease (metastatic bile duct carcinoma) has 
   a reference to a high-quality registry source (GLOBOCAN 2005). Others lack 
   specific epidemiological studies.

3. Confidence Levels: Overall confidence is moderate to low across the dataset, 
   reflecting the lack of unified epidemiological data for most conditions.

4. Subtype Identification: 2 of 5 diseases were identified as subtypes with 
   parent disease categories, showing hierarchical relationships.

5. Geographic Variation: 3 diseases show high geographic variation, requiring 
   caution when applying global estimates to specific regions.
