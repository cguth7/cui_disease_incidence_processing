  "reasoning": "Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are better characterized by prevalence than incidence, as they are congenital/developmental vascular malformations often remaining asymptomatic. MRI and autopsy studies show prevalence of 0.4-0.5% of population (~400 per 100k). Most are sporadic (80%) and discovered incidentally. Annual symptomatic presentation rate much lower (~0.5 per 100k), but total prevalence is the more meaningful epidemiological metric.",
