Incidence of new infections: estimated 1-2% of susceptible population annually, roughly 1,500 per 100k person-years for primary infections (combining HSV-1 and HSV-2). This is somewhat of an umbrella term (HSV-1 vs HSV-2 have different epidemiology), reducing confidence. Data quality strong for prevalence, moderate for incidence.",
