PROCESSING RESULTS
================================================================================

1. C0241950 - Intestinal infarction
   Status: PROCESSED
   File: C0241950.json

   Metric: Incidence
   Incidence Rate: 5.2 per 100,000 person-years
   Global Cases/Year: 416,000
   Confidence Score: 0.65 (moderate)
   Data Quality: Moderate
   Geographic Variation: Moderate

   Classification: Acute vascular event
   Hierarchy: Primary disease (parent category: Intestinal ischemia)
   Reasoning: Acute intestinal infarction is an acute mesenteric ischemia with
   tissue necrosis, estimated at ~5 per 100k based on hospitalization data and
   case studies.

================================================================================

2. C0079680 - Lentivirus Infections
   Status: PROCESSED
   File: C0079680.json

   Metrics: Both incidence and prevalence
   Incidence Rate: 0.8 per 100,000 person-years
   Prevalence Rate: 135 per 100,000
   Global Cases/Year: 64,000 (incidence basis)
   Confidence Score: 0.72 (good)
   Data Quality: Strong
   Geographic Variation: High

   Classification: Infectious disease (HIV/AIDS)
   Hierarchy: Primary disease
   Geographic Notes: Sub-Saharan Africa >1500 per 100k vs developed countries <50
   per 100k
   Reasoning: Lentivirus infections primarily refers to HIV/AIDS with strong global
   surveillance data, though significant geographic variation exists.

================================================================================

3. C0034219 - Alveolar pyorrhea
   Status: PROCESSED
   File: C0034219.json

   Metric: Prevalence (chronic condition)
   Prevalence Rate: 25,000 per 100,000
   Global Cases/Year: 2,000,000,000
   Confidence Score: 0.68 (moderate-good)
   Data Quality: Moderate
   Geographic Variation: High

   Classification: Chronic periodontal disease
   Hierarchy: Subtype of Periodontitis
   Prevalence Range: 5-90% by region and definition
   Reasoning: Alveolar pyorrhea is a severe form of periodontitis with purulent
   inflammation and alveolar bone loss. As a chronic condition, prevalence (~25%
   of population) is more appropriate than incidence.

================================================================================

4. C0025167 - Megakaryocytic hyperplasia
   Status: PROCESSED (Unmappable)
   File: C0025167.json

   Metric: None (pathological finding)
   Incidence Rate: Not available (null)
   Prevalence Rate: Not available (null)
   Confidence Score: 0.10 (very low)
   Data Quality: None

   Classification: Morphologic descriptor / secondary condition
   Hierarchy: Secondary finding in hematopoietic disorders
   Reasoning: Megakaryocytic hyperplasia is NOT a primary disease but a
   pathological finding secondary to other conditions (myeloproliferative
   neoplasms, immune thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia). It cannot be
   meaningfully mapped to an independent incidence rate without specifying
   the primary condition.

================================================================================

5. C0342643 - Autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic vitamin D refractory rickets
   Status: PROCESSED
   File: C0342643.json

   Metric: Incidence (for rare genetic disorder)
   Incidence Rate: Extremely rare (<0.01 per 100,000 births)
   Global Cases/Year: Extremely rare
   Confidence Score: 0.35 (low)
   Data Quality: Weak
   Geographic Variation: Unknown

   Classification: Rare genetic metabolic disorder
   Hierarchy: Subtype of Hypophosphatemic rickets
   Known Cases: ~100-200 reported globally
   Reasoning: This is an extremely rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder
   causing vitamin D-resistant rickets. Low confidence due to limited
   epidemiological data and reliance on case reports rather than population-
   based surveillance.

KEY FINDINGS AND INTERPRETATIONS
================================================================================

1. MAPPABLE DISEASES (4 of 5):
   Four CUI codes successfully mapped to epidemiological estimates with varying
   confidence levels.

2. UNMAPPABLE DISEASE (1 of 5):
   Megakaryocytic hyperplasia (C0025167) is fundamentally unmappable as an
   independent disease entity. It's a morphologic descriptor of a secondary finding
   that requires knowledge of the primary condition to estimate incidence/prevalence.

3. CONFIDENCE VARIATION:
   - Highest confidence (0.72): Lentivirus Infections (HIV/AIDS) - well-established
     global surveillance
   - Lowest confidence (0.10): Megakaryocytic hyperplasia - not an independent disease
   - Moderate confidence (0.35-0.68): Rare genetic disease and chronic conditions
     with limited epidemiological data or heterogeneous definitions

4. METRIC APPROPRIATENESS:
   - Acute conditions (Intestinal infarction, Lentivirus Infections): Incidence used
   - Chronic conditions (Alveolar pyorrhea): Prevalence used
   - Mixed (Lentivirus): Both metrics provided (epidemiologically relevant for HIV)

5. GEOGRAPHIC VARIABILITY:
   High geographic variation noted for 3 conditions:
   - Lentivirus Infections: >30-fold difference between high and low prevalence regions
   - Alveolar pyorrhea: Huge variation in prevalence (5-90%) due to definitions and
     oral health infrastructure
   - Intestinal infarction: Moderate variation related to healthcare access

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PHARMACEUTICAL USE
================================================================================

1. LENTIVIRUS INFECTIONS (C0079680):
   RECOMMENDATION: Use prevalence estimate (135 per 100k) for market sizing
   - Confidence sufficient for preliminary market analysis
   - Account for high geographic variation in targeting strategies
   - Use region-specific prevalence data for accurate market assessment

2. INTESTINAL INFARCTION (C0241950):
   RECOMMENDATION: Use incidence estimate (5.2 per 100k) with caution
   - Confidence moderate; consider sensitivity analysis
   - Data quality relies on hospitalization records
   - Monitor for improved epidemiological data sources

3. ALVEOLAR PYORRHEA (C0034219):
   RECOMMENDATION: Use prevalence with caveat of definitional ambiguity
   - High prevalence (25%) but highly variable by region
   - Consider separating by severity levels if possible
   - Note that clinical vs. subclinical cases may inflate estimates

4. MEGAKARYOCYTIC HYPERPLASIA (C0025167):
   RECOMMENDATION: DO NOT USE as independent disease indicator
   - Cannot be mapped to meaningful incidence/prevalence
   - Requires context of primary hematologic disorder
   - If needed for analysis, map to underlying conditions instead
   - Example: If occurring in ITP, use ITP incidence/prevalence instead

5. VITAMIN D-REFRACTORY RICKETS (C0342643):
   RECOMMENDATION: Use only for ultra-rare disease portfolios
   - Confidence very low; extremely limited patient population
   - Suitable only for specialized genetic disorder pharmaceutical development
   - May be more relevant for specialized genetic counseling applications
