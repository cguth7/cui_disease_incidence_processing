KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. All 5 diseases were successfully processed with complete epidemiological data
2. Four diseases were identified as disease subtypes with parent-disease relationships
3. Confidence scores range from 0.45 to 0.72, reflecting varying data quality
4. Two rare lymphoma subtypes (Burkitt-like and ALK+ DLBCL) have very low incidence
5. Most diseases have adequate epidemiological data, with sources documented
6. Geographic variation is significant for hemato-oncologic conditions

================================================================================
PROCESSING COMPLETE
================================================================================
All requested CUI disease codes have been mapped to incidence/prevalence data
following the cui-incidence-mapper_2 skill guidelines and quality standards.
