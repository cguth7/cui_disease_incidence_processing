  "reasoning": "AJCC v7 Stage II colorectal cancer incidence estimated from global colorectal cancer incidence (~20-25 per 100k) with Stage II comprising approximately 30-35% of cases at diagnosis. AJCC v7 staging has slightly different criteria than TNM alone, resulting in slightly lower Stage II estimate (~8.2 per 100k). Confidence reflects derivation from proportional staging rather than direct AJCC v7-specific registry.",
