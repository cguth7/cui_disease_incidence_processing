'Splenic Diseases' encompasses: hemolytic anemias (sickle cell, thalassemia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia), lymphoproliferative disorders (lymphoma, leukemia), infections (malaria, tuberculosis, sepsis), trauma, infarction, storage diseases, and functional/structural abnormalities. These conditions have vastly different incidence rates (sickle cell ~0.1-1 per 100k, lymphomas ~15-20 per 100k, malaria millions annually). Aggregate BOTEC estimate not meaningful without defining component diseases and their prevalence by geography. Requires specification of splenic pathology type.",
