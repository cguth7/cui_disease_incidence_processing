  "reasoning": "Congenital blindness encompasses multiple etiologies (congenital cataracts, optic nerve hypoplasia, Leber congenital amaurosis, retinopathy of prematurity). Global incidence estimated at 0.8-1.5 per 100k live births based on pediatric ophthalmology surveys. Moderate confidence due to significant geographic variation in prevalence of causes (e.g., retinopathy of prematurity higher in middle-income countries).",
