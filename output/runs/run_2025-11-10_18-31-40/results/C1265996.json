  "reasoning": "Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) represents approximately 1-3% of all lung cancers. With global lung cancer incidence at ~50-60 per 100k, LCNEC is estimated at ~1.5 per 100k. Confidence is moderate due to well-documented pathology classification and cancer registry data, but limited epidemiological specificity for this rare subtype.",
