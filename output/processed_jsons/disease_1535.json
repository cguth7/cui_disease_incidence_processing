Prevalence estimated at ~15,000 per 100k based on imaging prevalence studies. Confidence reduced due to high heterogeneity of benign tumors, wide variation by detection method (imaging vs autopsy), and lack of standardized surveillance data. Reported as prevalence (existing cases) rather than incidence, as these are chronic lesions typically discovered incidentally.",
