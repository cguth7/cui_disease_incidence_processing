Prevalence estimated as aggregate of major subcategories: congenital abnormalities (~200 per 100k), myopia/hyperopia/astigmatism (~2000 per 100k), other acquired abnormalities (~300 per 100k). Aggregate estimate ~2500 per 100k. Low confidence due to heterogeneity and overlap between categories, and difficulty isolating specific epidemiological data for broad umbrella term.",
