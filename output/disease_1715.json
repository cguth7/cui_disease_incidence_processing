    "reasoning": "Failure to Thrive is a pediatric clinical syndrome characterized by inadequate weight gain/growth, not a specific disease entity. Measured as prevalence in pediatric populations, estimated 7.5-10% of children in developing countries (7,500-10,000 per 100k) and 1-3% in developed countries. Used prevalence rather than incidence due to lack of systematic incidence tracking, variable case definitions, and heterogeneous etiology (organic vs non-organic causes). Limited to pediatric/hospital-based studies without comprehensive global registry.",
