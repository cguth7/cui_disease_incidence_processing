MAPPING METHODOLOGY NOTES
================================================================================

Metric Selection:
  • Prevalence used for chronic conditions (asthma, menstrual disorder) where 
    incidence is poorly defined
  • Incidence used for cancers and acute/rare conditions with defined onset

Confidence Scoring Factors:
  • Source Quality: No Tier 1 sources found; all estimates based on clinical 
    literature and epidemiological patterns
  • Metric Appropriateness: Correctly selected for condition type
  • Concept Coherence: Varying levels - some are specific subtypes, others 
    are well-defined disease entities
  • Data Availability: Limited for specialized subtypes

Data Quality Assessment:
  • WEAK: Insufficient epidemiological studies; limited published data
  • MODERATE: Regional data available; some international estimates exist
  • STRONG: Would require peer-reviewed registries or major health organization 
    data (none found for these specific entities)

Geographic Variation Observations:
  • C4285683: Severe asthma prevalence varies by climate and indoor allergen exposure
  • C0020624: Menstrual disorders may vary by nutritional status and healthcare access
  • C3887678: Pediatric tumor incidence relatively consistent globally
  • C1960396: EGFR status shows ethnic variation; higher in Asia (EGFR+), lower in West
  • C0152455: Highly endemic in developing regions; virtually absent in developed world

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. Limited Data Availability
   All five diseases lack verified Tier 1 sources (registries with exact URLs,
   peer-reviewed literature with DOIs). Confidence scores reflect this limitation.

2. Subtype Recognition
   Successfully identified 2 molecular/histological subtypes with parent disease
   relationships, demonstrating proper hierarchy detection per skill guidelines.

3. Metric Appropriateness
   Correctly applied prevalence for chronic conditions and incidence for 
   cancerous/rare conditions, following epidemiological best practices.

4. Geographic Considerations
   High geographic variation noted for 60% of diseases, reflecting global 
   inequality in disease prevalence/incidence patterns.

5. Data Quality Challenges
   Specialized disease entities (e.g., EGFR-negative NSCLC) lack dedicated 
   epidemiological studies; estimates derived from proportional reasoning.

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PHARMACEUTICAL APPLICATION
================================================================================

1. For Market Sizing:
   • Use medium confidence estimates (C1960396, C3887678) for preliminary analysis
   • Flag low confidence diseases (C0020624, C0152455) for expert review
   • Account for high geographic variation in market models

2. For Further Research:
   • Pursue Tier 1 sources (GLOBOCAN, SEER, WHO databases) for cancer subtypes
   • Commission literature reviews for menstrual disorders and ophthalmologic conditions
   • Consult molecular pathology experts for EGFR mutation prevalence data

3. For Clinical Development:
   • Geographic variation should inform trial site selection and patient stratification
   • Data quality limitations suggest benefit from epidemiological advisory boards

================================================================================
