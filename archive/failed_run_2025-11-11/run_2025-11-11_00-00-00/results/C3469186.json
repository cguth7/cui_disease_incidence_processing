  "reasoning": "Type 1 hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder with well-characterized genetics (HFE mutations). Genetic studies indicate ~1 in 200-400 individuals carry homozygous mutations in European populations, but clinical disease manifestation is lower (~1-2 per 100k per year). Incidence of clinical disease varies by ethnicity: highest in Northern European/Celtic populations, lower in other groups. Moderate confidence due to strong genetic data but variable clinical penetrance and diagnostic criteria.",
