Estimated incidence based on andrology studies suggests ~5-10% of infertile men present with azoospermia, and infertility affects ~7-8% of reproductive-age population. Extrapolating to general population incidence ~20-25 per 100k per year. Moderate confidence due to limited epidemiological incidence studies; most data is prevalence-based in infertile populations.",
