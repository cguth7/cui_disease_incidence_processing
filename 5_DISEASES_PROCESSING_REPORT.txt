================================================================================
QUALITY NOTES
================================================================================

High Confidence Results (0.7+):
- Wet AMD (0.75): Strong data from epidemiological studies and registries
  with 2019 US prevalence data and global estimates.

Moderate Confidence Results (0.4-0.7):
- Macroalbuminuria (0.65): Reasonable prevalence data from diabetic 
  nephropathy literature, but limited data specific to macroalbuminuric 
  stage. Geographic variation reflects different risk by ethnicity/region.

Low Confidence Results (<0.4):
- HH3 (0.45), HH4 (0.40): Limited published epidemiological data for these
  specific genetic subtypes. Estimates based on proportion of genetic forms
  within broader IHH category. Recommend specialist review for these conditions.

- OI Type VII (0.25): Extremely rare condition with very limited published
  data. Estimate marked as "extremely rare". Confidence reflects extreme
  data scarcity and autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.

Recommendations for Improvement:
1. Macroalbuminuria: Seek stage-specific prevalence data from large cohorts
2. HH3 & HH4: Collect data from genetic registries and specialist centers
3. OI Type VII: Consider contacting rare disease registries or genetic databases
