CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION
=============================================================================

High (0.7-1.0):        0 diseases
Medium (0.3-0.7):      3 diseases (C1622510, C1845862, C1844376)
Low (0.1-0.3):         1 disease (C4049182)
Unmappable (0.0):      1 disease (C0033587)

=============================================================================
NOTES
=============================================================================

- C0033587 (Prosthesis Loosening) is unmappable as a disease entity since it
  is a surgical complication that depends on context (type of prosthesis,
  surgical technique, patient population).

- C1622510 (Neurocytoma) has low confidence due to being a rare tumor with
  limited epidemiological data available.

- C1845862 (Creatine deficiency, X-linked) is marked as "extremely rare" and
  has very low incidence, typical for rare genetic metabolic disorders.

- C1844376 (X-CGD) and C4049182 (Idiopathic partial epilepsy) have moderate
  confidence levels with epidemiological support from peer-reviewed literature.
