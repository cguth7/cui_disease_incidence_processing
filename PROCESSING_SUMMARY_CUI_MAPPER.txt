KEY FINDINGS & NOTES
================================================================================

1. Pulmonary Fibrosis (2022):
   - Relatively rare but serious condition
   - Moderate confidence based on epidemiological literature
   - Good geographic consistency across regions
   - Age-related disease (predominantly affects older adults)

2. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (2067):
   - Very common acute infection
   - High incidence due to annual infection cycles
   - Significant geographic and age variation
   - Pediatric and elderly populations at highest risk

3. Pleural Effusion (2555):
   - Secondary condition (symptom of underlying disease)
   - Multiple etiologies limit precision of estimates
   - Moderate confidence due to heterogeneous causes
   - Common in hospital settings

4. Psychotic Disorders (2016):
   - Umbrella term with significant diagnostic variation
   - Prevalence-based estimate (no clear incidence definition)
   - Lower confidence due to heterogeneity of subtypes
   - Significant variation in diagnostic criteria globally

5. Cataract (2703):
   - Most common cause of blindness globally
   - Strong data quality from WHO Vision 2020 initiative
   - Highest confidence score in this batch (0.85)
   - Clear age-related progression pattern
   - Good opportunity for pharmaceutical interventions

================================================================================
PROCESSING METHOD
================================================================================

All 5 diseases were processed using the cui-incidence-mapper_2 skill, which
provides detailed guidelines for:

- CUI to disease mapping accuracy assessment
- Epidemiological data source quality verification
- Confidence scoring based on data availability and source tier
- Disease hierarchy detection (subtypes vs umbrella terms)
- Geographic variation documentation
- Metric appropriateness (incidence vs prevalence selection)

The skill instructions ensure consistent, high-quality mapping of UMLS codes
to verifiable epidemiological data suitable for pharmaceutical market analysis.
