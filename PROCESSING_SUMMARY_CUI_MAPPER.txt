========================================
NOTES
========================================

1. Three diseases (C4749856, C1853223) are extremely rare genetic syndromes with minimal 
   epidemiological data. Confidence scores appropriately low (0.2-0.25).

2. Parasitic infection (C0747256) processed as aggregate BOTEC estimate summing major 
   parasitic conditions (malaria, schistosomiasis, hookworm, etc.). Confidence 0.3 reflects 
   heterogeneity of umbrella term.

3. Aspergillosis (C0004030) has moderate confidence (0.62) based on hospital surveillance 
   data and epidemiological literature. High geographic variation noted due to immune status 
   and regional factors.

4. Carcinoma in situ of fallopian tube (C0347176) classified as subtype of female genital 
   carcinoma with estimated incidence from cancer registries. Moderate confidence (0.45) 
   due to rarity and limited literature.

5. All results saved in required JSON format with complete metadata including reasoning, 
   data quality assessment, confidence scoring, and geographic variation information.

6. No sources required fabrication. Where verifiable sources unavailable, confidence 
   appropriately lowered and source fields set to null per skill guidelines.
