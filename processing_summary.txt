PROCESSING RESULTS
==================

1. C0393519 - Cerebellar Ataxia, Early Onset
   - Metric Type: Prevalence
   - Prevalence: 1.5 per 100k
   - Confidence: 0.45 (Moderate)
   - Data Quality: Moderate
   - Is Subtype: Yes (Parent: Cerebellar Ataxia)
   - Status: Successfully processed
   - Notes: Rare early-onset neurological condition. No systematic incidence data. Prevalence estimated from genetic ataxia literature.

2. C0521659 - Motor Neuron Disease, Upper
   - Metric Type: Prevalence
   - Prevalence: 2.0 per 100k
   - Confidence: 0.35 (Low-Moderate)
   - Data Quality: Weak
   - Is Subtype: Yes (Parent: Motor Neuron Disease)
   - Status: Successfully processed
   - Notes: Subcategory with heterogeneous phenotypes. Limited systematic epidemiological data.

3. C0543858 - Motor Neuron Disease, Secondary
   - Metric Type: Prevalence
   - Prevalence: 1.0 per 100k
   - Confidence: 0.30 (Low)
   - Data Quality: Weak
   - Is Subtype: Yes (Parent: Motor Neuron Disease)
   - Status: Successfully processed
   - Notes: Vague category definition with no specific epidemiological studies. Represents secondary forms of MND.

4. C0154681 - Anterior Horn Cell Disease
   - Metric Type: Incidence
   - Incidence: 1.8 per 100k
   - Confidence: 0.50 (Moderate)
   - Data Quality: Moderate
   - Is Subtype: Yes (Parent: Motor Neuron Disease)
   - Status: Successfully processed
   - Notes: Based on SMA epidemiological data (1:6000-1:10000 live births). Confidence limited by heterogeneity.

5. C0270764 - Motor Neuron Disease, Lower
   - Metric Type: Prevalence
   - Prevalence: 2.5 per 100k
   - Confidence: 0.40 (Low-Moderate)
   - Data Quality: Weak
   - Is Subtype: Yes (Parent: Motor Neuron Disease)
   - Status: Successfully processed
   - Notes: Lower motor neuron involvement includes progressive muscular atrophy. Lacks systematic epidemiological data.

SUMMARY STATISTICS
==================
- Total Processed: 5/5 (100%)
- Average Confidence: 0.40
- High Confidence (>0.7): 0
- Moderate Confidence (0.4-0.7): 2
- Low Confidence (<0.4): 3
- Using Incidence Data: 1
- Using Prevalence Data: 4
- Subtypes Identified: 5/5
- Errors Encountered: None
- Source Quality Issues: All diseases have limited published epidemiological data; several lack verifiable sources

KEY FINDINGS
============
1. All 5 diseases are motor neuron-related subtypes within broader MND categories
2. These are rare neurological conditions with limited epidemiological literature
3. Confidence scores are generally moderate to low due to:
   - Lack of systematic population-based epidemiological studies
   - Heterogeneous disease definitions
   - Limited data availability for rare subtypes
4. Geographic variation data is limited
5. Most diseases use prevalence rather than incidence as appropriate metric

RECOMMENDATIONS
================
1. Diseases with confidence <0.4 may need additional clinical consultation
2. Consider aggregating into broader "Motor Neuron Disease" category for more robust estimates
3. Search for disease-specific registries (e.g., SMA registries for anterior horn cell disease)
4. Updates recommended as new epidemiological data becomes available
