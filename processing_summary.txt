CUI DISEASE INCIDENCE MAPPING - PROCESSING SUMMARY
==========================================================================

PROCESSING DATE: 2025-11-12
SKILL USED: cui-incidence-mapper_2
DISEASES PROCESSED: 5

==========================================================================
PROCESSING RESULTS
==========================================================================

1. C0042721 - Viral hepatitis
   Location: /home/user/cui_disease_incidence_processing/output/results/C0042721.json
   Incidence: 8.5 per 100k person-years (aggregate estimate)
   Confidence: 0.28 (low - aggregate umbrella term)
   Type: Aggregate BOTEC estimate
   Data Quality: Weak
   Geographic Variation: High
   
   Details: This is an umbrella term aggregating hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E.
   The aggregate estimate sums major viral hepatitis types across different
   geographic regions and transmission routes. Low confidence reflects the
   heterogeneous nature of viral hepatitis subtypes.

2. C0752304 - Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy
   Location: /home/user/cui_disease_incidence_processing/output/results/C0752304.json
   Incidence: 180.0 per 100k births
   Confidence: 0.72 (moderate-high)
   Type: Perinatal neurological condition
   Data Quality: Moderate
   Geographic Variation: High
   
   Details: Birth asphyxia-related encephalopathy with estimated incidence
   of 1-5 per 1000 live births globally (~180 per 100k). Rates vary
   significantly between high-income and low-income countries based on
   quality of obstetric care.

3. C0268119 - Combined molybdoflavoprotein enzyme deficiency
   Location: /home/user/cui_disease_incidence_processing/output/results/C0268119.json
   Incidence: Extremely rare (<0.01 per 100k)
   Confidence: 0.32 (low - insufficient data)
   Type: Rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder
   Data Quality: Weak
   Geographic Variation: Unknown
   
   Details: Very rare genetic metabolic disorder affecting molybdenum
   cofactor synthesis. Fewer than 100 cases reported in medical literature
   worldwide. Exact global incidence unknown; low confidence reflects
   limited epidemiological data.

4. C0206683 - Papillary and follicular adenocarcinoma
   Location: /home/user/cui_disease_incidence_processing/output/results/C0206683.json
   Incidence: 12.0 per 100k person-years
   Confidence: 0.75 (moderate-high)
   Type: Thyroid cancer subtype (differentiated thyroid carcinoma)
   Data Quality: Moderate
   Geographic Variation: Moderate
   
   Details: Combined incidence of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and
   follicular thyroid cancer (FTC). PTC is 3-4 times more common than FTC.
   Data primarily from cancer registries in North America, Europe, and Asia.

5. C2751807 - Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy 4
   Location: /home/user/cui_disease_incidence_processing/output/results/C2751807.json
   Incidence: Extremely rare (<0.01 per 100k)
   Confidence: 0.38 (low - insufficient data)
   Type: Rare autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy
   Data Quality: Weak
   Geographic Variation: Unknown
   
   Details: Autosomal recessive form of EDMD caused by SYNE1 mutations.
   Fewer than 50 cases reported in medical literature. Overall EDMD
   incidence <1 per 100k; EDMD4 represents a small fraction.

NOTES ON DATA QUALITY
==========================================================================

1. Viral Hepatitis (C0042721):
   - Flagged as aggregate umbrella estimate
   - Confidence capped at 0.28 per skill guidelines for aggregate BOTEC estimates
   - Requires specification of hepatitis type (A, B, C, D, or E) for higher confidence

2. Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (C0752304):
   - Perinatal metric specific to live births
   - High geographic variation reflects development status
   - Incidence expressed per 100k births rather than general population

3. Molybdoflavoprotein Enzyme Deficiency (C0268119):
   - Extremely rare genetic disorder with <100 reported cases
   - No systematic epidemiological studies available
   - Confidence limited by scarcity of data

4. Papillary and Follicular Adenocarcinoma (C0206683):
   - Moderate confidence from cancer registry data
   - Could be improved by specifying PTC vs FTC separately
   - GLOBOCAN provides reasonable global estimates

5. Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy 4 (C2751807):
   - Very rare genetic subtype (<50 reported cases)
   - Limited epidemiological literature
   - Confidence reflects insufficient population-based data
